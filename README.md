### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, we use Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major
cities in the United States-Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The python code, imports the data and answers interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics in an interactive environment.

The program computes interesting statistics on:
Popular times to travel: most common travel month, day of week and hour of day
Popular stations and trip: most common start and end station
Trip duration: total and average travel time
User info: count of each user type, counts of gender

### Files used
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
Gender
Birth Year
